# Aspect Me


Intercept and change the behavior of a public method of a class before, after, or around that function call.

In aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification. This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic to be added to a program without cluttering the code, core to the functionality.
